In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), relative and absolute positioning are two different ways to control the placement of elements on a web page. They are part of the CSS positioning system, which allows you to precisely control the position of elements within the layout of a web page.

1. Relative Positioning:
   - Relative positioning is based on the element's natural position in the document flow. It allows you to adjust an element's position relative to where it would normally be placed in the document flow.
   - When you use relative positioning, an element is moved from its default position, but it still takes up space in the layout as if it were in its original location. In other words, it leaves an empty space where it was originally in the document flow.
   - You can use the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties to adjust the position of a relatively positioned element relative to its original position.

   Example:
   ```css
   .relative-box {
     position: relative;
     top: 20px;
     left: 10px;
   }
   ```

2. Absolute Positioning:
   - Absolute positioning allows you to completely remove an element from the document flow and position it anywhere on the page relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor element with a positioning other than `static`, which is the default).
   - Absolute positioned elements do not take up any space in the layout, and other elements will flow around them.
   - You can use the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties to specify the exact position of an absolutely positioned element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.

   Example:
   ```css
   .absolute-box {
     position: absolute;
     top: 50px;
     left: 100px;
   }
   ```

Key Differences:

1. Document Flow: Relative elements maintain their place in the document flow, while absolute elements are removed from the document flow.

2. Space Occupation: Relative elements still occupy space in the layout, whereas absolute elements do not occupy space, and other elements can overlap them.

3. Reference Point: Relative elements are positioned relative to their default position, while absolute elements are positioned relative to their nearest positioned ancestor.

4. Scroll Behavior: Relative elements move with the scroll, while absolute elements remain fixed in their position.

In summary, relative positioning adjusts an element's position relative to its default position in the document flow and retains its space, while absolute positioning removes an element from the document flow and positions it relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, allowing for precise control of its position on the page.
