The `z-index` property is a CSS property that is used to control the stacking order of elements in a web page. Elements in a web page are often displayed on top of each other, and the `z-index` property determines the order in which they are stacked. Elements with higher `z-index` values are displayed on top of elements with lower `z-index` values.

Here's the basic syntax of the `z-index` property:

```css
element {
  z-index: value;
}
```

- `element`: This is the HTML element you want to apply the `z-index` to, like a `div`, `img`, or any other HTML element.
- `value`: This is a numeric value, and it can be either a positive integer, negative integer, or zero. Elements with higher `z-index` values are stacked on top of elements with lower values.

Here's a simple example:

HTML:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="box" id="box1">This is box 1</div>
  <div class="box" id="box2">This is box 2</div>
</body>
</html>
```

CSS (styles.css):
```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  position: absolute;
  background-color: lightblue;
  border: 2px solid blue;
}

#box1 {
  left: 50px;
  top: 50px;
  z-index: 1;
}

#box2 {
  left: 100px;
  top: 100px;
  z-index: 2;
}
```

In this example, we have two `div` elements with the class `box`, and we've given them different `z-index` values. The `#box1` element has a `z-index` of 1, and the `#box2` element has a `z-index` of 2. As a result, the "box2" element will be displayed on top of "box1" because it has a higher `z-index` value.
